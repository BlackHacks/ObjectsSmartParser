# What is this?

SmartObjectParser is a _C#_ .library that allows a dev to rapidly parse and store objects or a List of objects to a file (or String) and ultimately restore them without any additional effort.

The Library is written to provide as much abstraction as it could in order to facilitate us, poor developer's lives. 

For now it supports writing only to clear text but ultimately support will be added for Binary Streams.

# What is included ? 

This Visual Studio solution contains a SmartObjectParser.cs that does all the magic and a form to allow actual testing of the library.
